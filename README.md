# Kijang-emas-price-prediction
  Kijang Emas is a gold bullion coin issued by Bank Negara Malaysia. Predicting the price of Kijang Emas can be valuable for investors and collectors. This project leverages historical data, economic indicators, and machine learning models to make accurate price predictions.

Data Preprocessing:

  Data preprocessing involves cleaning the collected data, handling missing values, and normalizing features. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for model training. Specific steps include:

1.Handling missing values through imputation.

2.Normalizing data to ensure consistency.

3.Feature engineering to create additional relevant features.

Evaluation:

  The models are evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score. We also perform cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models. Evaluation steps include:

1.Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2.Training each model on the training set.

3.Evaluating model performance on the testing set.

4.Using cross-validation to assess model stability.
